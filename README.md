# MonokumaAnimation
Creative animations using UIKit in swift

# Why I did it
As someone who loves games and coding i ahd to use one of my favorites as inspiration for this study project.
My goal was to test out how to make custom transitions through view controllers, this one specifically from a circle shape, but also how to animate simple objects (like a UIImageView)into something that looks fancy.

# Sample
Probably there's a lot to improve on the code, but the final result looks very satisfying to me
