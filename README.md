# MonokumaAnimation
Creative animations using UIKit in swift

# Why I did it
As someone who loves games and coding, i HAD to use one of my favorites as inspiration for this study project.
My goal was to test out how to make custom transitions through view controllers, this one specifically from a circle shape, but also how to animate simple objects (like a UIImageView) into something that looks fancy and way more interesting.

# What you will find in the project
Circle ViewController transition animation.  
Custom assets made by me in Sketch.  
Simple Object animations.  
Timed animations for chain effect.  

# Sample
Probably there's a lot to improve on the code, but the final result looks very satisfying to me
